 My goal with the content I aim to put out is to be **interesting**, **problem-facing** and **complete**. 
 
 #### Interesting
 Interesting is something subjective. What I tend to find interesting  but through my various years working in Tech, I have narrowed down my current interests to the following:
 1. Deep Dives (e.g. Internal Workings of Systems)
 2. Performance
 3. Distributed Systems Concepts
 
 #### Problem-Facing
 
  Solutions to problems are one thing, you can probably find them in StackOverflow or someother Q&A platform. I am more interested in the problems I am interested in. With that being said,
  I may not always find the optimal solution or any solution for that matter, but I want to be able to effectively contend with the problem, outline why the problem is challenging and give insight into some possible solutions. If the result is a good solution, then Hooray!, if not, hopefully you'll come away with deeper insight and appreciation to the problem, and maybe you can be inspired to solve it!
  
 
 #### Complete
 
 I've been writing articles for about 4 years now. I've noticed that there sometimes is a rush to get things out there quickly and succintly which I advocate for. However I am not afraid of having an article be 2000+ words or a video being 3+ hours if it takes that long to complete the task at hand. I will do my best to be concise where I can as much as I can.
 
 I intend to output 
  Articles or YouTube videos that go from idea conception to completion in their entirety in the best way I know how, including important things like
   - Unit Tests,
   - GitHub READMEs
   - CI/CD or Deployments where necessary. 
 
  
 
 
 ## Website Formatting
 
 I am using [**mdBook**](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) to generate the structure of this entire website. Check them out, star them or clone their repo to use it!
